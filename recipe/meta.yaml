  summary: A tool for detecting memory errors, and an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools.

  description: |
    Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. There are Valgrind tools that can
    automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your programs in detail. You can also use
    Valgrind to build new tools.  The Valgrind distribution currently includes six production-quality tools: a memory
    error detector, two thread error detectors, a cache and branch-prediction profiler, a call-graph generating cache and
    branch-prediction profiler, and a heap profiler. It also includes three experimental tools: a stack/global array
    overrun detector, a second heap profiler that examines how heap blocks are used, and a SimPoint basic block vector
    generator.
